penguins = [p for p in all_players if p['team'] == 'PIT']

# Analyze stats
top_shooters = sorted(all_players, 
    key=lambda x: x['stats']['general_offense']['shots_per_60'], 
    reverse=True)[:10]
```

### **Use the Comprehensive Client:**
```python
from comprehensive_client import ComprehensiveAllThreeZonesClient

client = ComprehensiveAllThreeZonesClient()

# Get database stats
stats = client.get_database_stats()
print(f"Total players: {stats['total_players']}")
