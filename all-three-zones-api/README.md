```

### Adding New Endpoints

1. Add the endpoint function to `main.py`
2. Define response models using Pydantic
3. Add error handling
4. Update the API documentation

### Customizing the Scraper

The scraper in `a3z_scraper.py` may need customization based on the actual structure of the All Three Zones website:

1. **Login Process**: Update selectors for username/password fields
2. **Data Extraction**: Modify parsing logic for player/team data
3. **URL Structure**: Update URLs based on the actual site structure

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your All Three Zones credentials in the `.env` file
   - Check if the site structure has changed

2. **Chrome WebDriver Issues**
   - Ensure Chrome is installed
   - The webdriver-manager will automatically download the appropriate driver

3. **No Data Returned**
   - The site structure may have changed
   - Check the scraper logs for parsing errors
   - Update the selectors in `a3z_scraper.py`

### Logs

The API provides detailed logging. Check the console output for:
- Authentication status
- Scraping progress
- Error messages
- API request logs

## Security Considerations

- **Credentials**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control
- **CORS**: Configure CORS origins appropriately for production
- **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for production use
- **HTTPS**: Use HTTPS in production environments

## üéØ Current Status
